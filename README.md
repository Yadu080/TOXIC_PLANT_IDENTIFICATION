# AI-Powered Toxic Plant Identification

This project leverages the power of artificial intelligence to classify plants as **toxic** or **non-toxic** using image recognition. The system is designed to assist individuals in identifying harmful plants, helping to safeguard communities by preventing potential risks associated with toxic plant exposure.

---

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Determines whether a plant is toxic or non-toxic based on uploaded images.
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly interface to upload plant images and view results.
- **Deep Learning:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for high accuracy in plant classification.
- **Scalable Backend:** Flask-based API for efficient image processing and prediction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/AI-Powered-Toxic-Plant-Identification.git
   cd AI-Powered-Toxic-Plant-Identification
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the dataset:**
   - Ensure your dataset is available in CSV format with columns `path` (image path) and `toxicity` (0 for non-toxic, 1 for toxic).
   - Update the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook with the correct image paths and run it to preprocess the data.

4. **Train the model:**
   - Open `model_training.ipynb` and execute the cells to train the CNN model.
   - Save the trained model as `toxic_plant_classifier.h5`.

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py --port=5000
   ```

6. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `app.py`.
2. Upload a plant image using the web interface.
3. View the classification result (Toxic/Non-Toxic).

## How It Works

### Data Preprocessing
- Images are resized to 128x128 pixels and normalized.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

### Model Training
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset with binary classification output.

### Web Interface
- Built using Flask and HTML/CSS.
- Users can upload plant images, which are passed to the trained model for classification.
## ðŸ“· Demo

Upload an image of a plant and get a prediction on whether it's toxic.
